                <h1>What Accel Partners provides for us</h1>
                <h3>As our company is new Accel would provide us with start-up funding. Starting up a technology focused company has many financial risks such as server cost, office rental, programmer wages, as well as the initial costs of purchasing computers and internet for the working office.</h3>
                <br>
                <h3>The initial investment from Accel will alleviate the potential risks of a slow start to our company. Cybersecurity is known to result in small initial profits, possibly none, and this investment will allow our company to get off the slow start and build up a reputation without going bankrupt before then.</h3>
